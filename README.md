# Invoice Extractor Streamlit App

This repository contains a Streamlit-based application for extracting and querying information from invoices using the Gemini LLM (Large Language Model). The app allows users to upload invoice images and ask questions related to the content of the uploaded invoices. The model processes the image and provides relevant answers to user queries.

---

## Features
- **Upload Invoices**: Users can upload invoice images in supported formats (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.).
- **Question-Answering**: Ask specific questions related to the invoice content, such as "What is the total amount?" or "Who is the vendor?"
- **Powered by Gemini LLM**: Uses the Gemini Large Language Model to process invoice data and generate accurate responses.
- **Responsive Interface**: Streamlit ensures a user-friendly and interactive experience.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Anaconda (optional but recommended)
- Streamlit
- Access to Gemini LLM API and API key

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/invoice-extractor.git
   cd invoice-extractor
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Add your Gemini LLM API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
5. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Open the app in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Upload an invoice image using the provided file uploader.
3. Enter your question in the text input box (e.g., "What is the invoice number?").
4. View the response generated by the app.

## Requirements
Here are the major dependencies for the app:
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface
- **Pillow**: For image processing
- **Google Generative AI SDK**: For interacting with Gemini LLM

Install all dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues:
1. **Gemini API Key Error**:
   - Ensure the API key is valid and correctly placed in the `.env` file.

2. **Model Deprecation (404 Error)**:
   - Make sure you're using the latest version of the Gemini LLM (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash`).

3. **Streamlit Port Error**:
   - If the default port `8501` is busy, specify another port using:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py --server.port=8502
     ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multi-page PDF invoices.
- Enhance question-answering capabilities with more complex queries.
- Improve UI design for a better user experience.
- Include analytics for invoice data trends.
